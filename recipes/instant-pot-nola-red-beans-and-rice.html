    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Instant Pot rice and beans made with pork neck bones has been converted from a family recipe that we've used for 40+ years. Our family had come across it while in New Orleans when I was a little girl. From what I remember, red beans and rice were always made at home on Mondays using leftover pork bones from the weekend meals. It's deliciously flavorful and can be made as spicy as you'd like. I hope you love it as much as my own family does.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
